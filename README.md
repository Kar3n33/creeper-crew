# Project2

Creeper-Crew is the full stack development product of Project #2. Creeper-Crew is an App designed to tap into and assist with people's desire to visit some of the worlds most unusual places. The destinations may be so unusual you can't imagine doing it alone.

Creeper-Crew allows the user with a few clicks to not only find and research a creepy destination but also link-up with other  wanting to go on the same adventures at the same time.
